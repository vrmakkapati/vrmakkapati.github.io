I am a PhD candidate advised by [http://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html Prof. Panagiotis Tsiotras] and [https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~seth/index.php?u=home Prof. Seth Hutchinson].

I apply techniques from optimal control, reinforcement learning, and differential games to address problems pertaining to autonomous vehicles, emphasizing safe planning and airspace security.

Previously, I worked with [https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheen-siddiqui-84302711/ Dr. Matheen Siddiqui] at [https://www.foresight.ai/ Foresight AI Inc.] on motion planning and driving decision algorithms & software. During my masters at IIT Kanpur, I worked with [https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/mangal/ Dr. Mangal Kothari] on pursuit-evasion games and UAV guidance techniques.

*I am currently on the job market.*
